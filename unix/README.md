# Wallpaper Wizard X-based Systems
This is jsut one basic script as a suggestion. Customize it to your needs.
## Run
You can run this script once by executing
```[bash]
$ chmod +x get_wallpaper.sh && ./get_wallpaper.sh "https://ww.keefer.de" "sail" ""
```
This will get you a nice sailing boat as a background without syncing to anyone

## Install
There are many ways to install this. One is `# ln -s "$(pwd)/get_wallpaper.sh" /usr/bin/gw`\
The script will be systemwide accessible with the shortcut `gw`

## Upload
You can use the post_wallpaper script. As arguments, give url, a directory and some tags (separeted by ";") in that order. 
The script will then upload all JPG files to the server
